Data related to responses to visual stimuli were used to develop a rule for seperating people suffering from a multiple-sclerosis-caused visual pathology from those not suffering from the disease.

We were unable to find a data description, so we assume that this dataset is measuring response time in milliseconds between the two samples, where V2 is a measurement for stimulus 1 in milliseconds and V3 is the difference in respeonse time for each eye. This is also the case for V4 and V5, respectively and V6 our label (0 for Non-MS and 1 for MS).

# DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS


```{r include=FALSE}
descriptive <- function(x){
  xmean <- colMeans(x)
  xcov <- cov(x)
  xcovVar <- cov(x) * (nrow(x) -1) / nrow(x)
  xvar <- var(x)
  xcovInv <- solve(xcov)
  xdet <- det(xcov)

## FOR NMS GROUP
The mean age for the NMS group is lower than for the MS group.
The responses to stimuli 1 and 2 are faster in the NMS group compared to the MS group.
Finally, the differences between L and R are significantly higher in the MS group compared to the NMS group.

### COVARIANCE
V2 and V4
The covariance for the NMS sample is 106.78 whereas for the MS sample it is 912.41, which indicates a slower responsetime in the MS group. 

V3 and V5
When calculating the difference in respeonse time for each eye, the NMS group has differnce of 0.50. The MS group has a difference of 297.31 which again indicates a high difference between the two groups.

### VARIANCE-COVARIANCE

A variance-covariance matrix is a square matrix that contains the variances and covariances associated with several variables. The diagonal elements of the matrix contain the variances of the variables and the off-diagonal elements contain the covariances between all possible pairs of variables.
The variance-covariances associated with variables V2 and V4 for the NMS group is 105.23.

### VARIANCE
Variance tells us how much a quantity varies w.r.t. its mean. Its the spread of data around the mean value. You only know the magnitude here, as in how much the data is spread.
